PodArch Loadable Kernel Module
================================

This loadable kernel module is needed to intercept the ELF loader in PodArch
and check whether a executable is a pod binary or not and if yes then to execute
the pod_load instruction to notify the PodArch CPU about the binary being a pod.


Steps to compile
-----------------------
Type 'make' to compile the code and generate the loadable kernel module as 'pod_kret.ko'.

Usage
-------
Make sure you have loaded the kernel module before executing any pod binaries. To do so
insert the kernel module as 'insmod pod_kret.ko' as a root or sudo user.
