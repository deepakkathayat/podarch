======================
Hbench-OS for PodArch
======================

Only the x86_64 versions of this Hbench-OS directory have been ported for PodArch.

Compile Hbench-OS PodArch Binaries
------------------------------------

1.  bash pod_hbench.sh

    To compile the pod sealed binaries for Hbench in this directory run the command
    'bash pod_hbench.sh' from the top level directory.
  
    This will generate the static non-encrypted as well as pod sealed binaries in the
    directory "bin/linux_x86-64".


===========================
Directory and File Changes
===========================
1.  "pod_hbench.sh" is the shell script file in the top level directory containing
    the commands to compile the pod sealed binaries.

2.  "toolchain/" folder contains the PodArch toolchain executables needed for pod 
    sealing.

3.  "src" directory contains all of the source files along with and additional
    "pod_header.h" file. 

4.  "src/pod_header.h" contains the wrapper for system calls which are needed for
	pod sealing of binaries, to provide data encryption and decryption via the
	pod's public pages.

5.  Within the "src/" directory the source files(.c files) of hbench binaries have
    been modified to include "pod_header.h" which contains the wrappers for various
    system calls.

6.  "src/Makefile" has been changed to include "WRAP" flag which specifies the
    wrappers for system calls to be included during compilation of binaries.
    A LDFLAG1 flag has also been added which specifies "-static" for compiling
    binaries statically and uses the "toolchain/page_aligner" as the linker
    script for page aligning the sections of pod binary.

Note: For a better understanding of above briefed changes please go through the actual files.
