        using-hbench:           how to build, configure, and run HBench-OS
        benchmark-descriptions: descriptions of each of the benchmark tests,
                                what they measure, and what the arguments
                                to each test are
        interpreting-results:   how to use the supplied analysis scripts
                                to analyze and interpret the HBench-OS
                                results.
        sigmetrics97-paper.ps:  a paper presented at SIGMETRICS '97 on
                                HBench-OS and a proposed methodology for
                                using HBench-OS to understand OS performance

Further information on HBench-OS, including a case study of OS performance
using HBench-OS, can be found at:
